**TonalFlex** is an open-source platform for running professional audio plugins on embedded hardware ‚Äî portable, flexible, and fully remote-controllable.

Powered by [Elk Audio OS](https://github.com/elk-audio), TonalFlex transforms devices like the Raspberry Pi 4 into low-latency, headless DSP units capable of running multi-channel chains of VST3 plugins.

TonalFlex is a complete bundle of applications and plugins that transform your embedded hardware into a fully featured **Pro Audio System**.

Remote control everything wirelessly from your phone, tablet, or computer - or via **MIDI** over Bluetooth or USB.

## Key Features

- üéõ **One Plugin Codebase**  
  Write your audio plugins using JUCE and run them anywhere ‚Äî cross-compile for embedded Linux, or build desktop formats like VST3, AU, AAX, and LV2 for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

- üì± **Unified UI**  
  Design your plugin interfaces using modern web tools _(e.g. TypeScript, Vue, Vite)_. UIs run directly in desktop builds via JUCE WebView, and can also be packaged as `npm` micro frontends for use in the browser-based TonalFlex remote control UI ‚Äî the same GUI code runs everywhere!

- üïπÔ∏è **Remote Control**  
  Control your rig over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth ‚Äî no screen required. MIDI controlling is supported over USB and Bluetooth.

- üõ† **Fully Open Source**  
  Fork it. Hack it. Extend it. TonalFlex is built to be modified.

## üß™ Develop Your Own Plugins

Tonalflex provide a custom JUCE template for writing your own compatible plugins ‚Äî see the [tonalflex-plugin-template](https://github.com/tonalflex/tonalflex-plugin-template).

Once you have written your plugin, you will need to fork and add your plugins to the following repositores:

- [tonalflex-ui](https://github.com/tonalflex/tonalflex-ui)
- [tonalflex-bundle](https://github.com/tonalflex/tonalflex-bundle)

After that, you can pull your personal fork of the [tonalflex-bundle](https://github.com/tonalflex/tonalflex-bundle) to your embedded device running ElkOS in order to use your own plugins.
