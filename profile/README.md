**TonalFlex** is an open-source platform for high-quality, portable tone shaping — designed to be powerful, flexible, and easy to integrate into any rig.

Built around a compact, screenless hardware unit, TonalFlex is controlled remotely through your phone, tablet, or computer. The system is built for developers and tone enthusiasts alike, offering a unique architecture:

- **Audio processing powered by cross-compiled JUCE plugins** — write your DSP code in JUCE, compile it for the embedded hardware, and deploy it seamlessly.
- **Modern, customizable UI using WebView and Vue.js** — build your plugin interface using web technologies (Vue + Vite), and use the same codebase both in development and within the plugin itself via JUCE's WebView support.
- **Micro frontends via npm** — when deploying to the embedded device, plugin UIs are handled as independent micro frontends using npm, making each plugin lightweight, modular, and easy to update.
- **Remote-first interaction** — control the device wirelessly from a browser or mobile device, with no built-in screen required.
- **Modular and hackable** — from amplifier modeling to FX chains, everything is open, tweakable, and extendable.

Whether you’re crafting a custom pedalboard, building synth effects, or prototyping entirely new audio processors, TonalFlex gives you a fully open canvas — no vendor lock-in, no compromises.

**Shape sound on your terms. Build the rig you’ve always wanted!**
